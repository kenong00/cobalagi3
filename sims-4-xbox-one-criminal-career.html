                    <p align="justify">Keep busy ration this image. Rewards for bosses and oracles. In the criminal career, you will eventually have a choice of two different branches. Throughout the entire career, promotion bonuses are much larger than. Because once they reach the top of the evil branch the two sims will hate each other.</p>

                    <p align="justify">You will either choose to become a crime boss, being a leader of a gang, or follow the oracle branch to delve deeper into hacking and internet crimes. The jobs allow sims to treat patients, deliver babies, and perform surgeries. Criminal is a career track in the sims series. Each has their own highlights. I have played sims since it.</p>
